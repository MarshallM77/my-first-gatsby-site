This is a post regarding my favorite pet, Piper.

She is a Jack Russell, and is full of energy. She has always been a charmer, as you can see in this picture of her in 2020, when she was a puppy. She is very manipulative and plays multiple sides (usually
favoring whoever has food). However, we love her regardless!
